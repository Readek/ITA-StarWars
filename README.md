# ITA-StarWars

IT Academy's advanced introduction to React. This project uses **VITE**, **React**, **Firebase** to handle sign in and log in, and **SWAPI** for all of its data.

The project, themed around StarWars, gives you a list of starships shown on the films, clicking on any of them will send you to its details page where you will be given a starship description, as well as what characters have piloted the starship, and in which films it has appeared.

You can try out the project by going to its [GitHub Page](https://readek.github.io/ITA-StarWars/).

You can also install it locally. Clone the repo and run:

```
npm install
```

You will then be able to run a developer enviroment with:

```
npm run dev
```

Note that you will be required to provide your own Firebase API key and place it on an `.env` file:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_APIKEY = ((your_api_key))
```
